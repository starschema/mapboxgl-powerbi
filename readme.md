# Mapbox Visual for Microsoft Power BI

Make sense of your big & dynamic location data with the Mapbox Visual for Power BI.  Quickly design high-performance map visuals using graduated circles, clusters, and interactive heatmaps.  Even customize your Mapbox visual with custom shapes, imagery, and design using [Mapbox Studio](www.mapbox.com/studio).  Check out the [Mapbox Gallery](https://www.mapbox.com/gallery/) to get a sense of what's possible with Studio.

Drop in the Mapbox Visual to your Power BI dashboard from the [Microsoft Office Store](https://appsource.microsoft.com/en-us/product/power-bi-visuals/WA104381472?tab=Overview).

### FAQ

#### Firewall rules - Domain names and ports to use with Power BI in a secure environment

The Mapbox Visual by default operates using API resources hosted on `api.mapbox.com` securely requested using HTTPS and your Mapbox access token.  If you need all requests to be made inside of your corporate or air-gapped network, you can host [Mapbox Atlas](https://www.mapbox.com/atlas/) on your own server and run the Mapbox Visual for Power BI completely on-premise.

**No data** in the Power BI data model is ever sent to Mapbox APIs.  Only the requested reference resources including map style sheets, vector tiles, icons, and fonts are retrieved from Mapbox APIs.

| Domain          | Port | Resource                        |
|--------------------|------|-----------------------------|
| api.mapbox.com     | 443  | icons, map styles, fonts |
| *.tiles.mapbox.com | 443  | vector tiles                |

#### How many data points does the Mapbox Visual support?

Mapbox supports up to the maximum allowed by Power BI, 30,000 rows, for all visualization types including Choropleth (fill), cluster, heatmap, and circle.  If your data is >30k rows, the Mapbox Visual will sample your data down to 30k rows and visualize the resultant sample.  If you need to visualize more than 30k rows for your use case, reach out to our sales team to connect you with a Mapbox Partner to setup a custom solution for your use case.

### LastPass extension issue

#### Symptoms
When the LastPass extension is enabled the map doesn't appear and an error message is logged on the console:
```
VM4163:5639 Error: Failed to execute 'fetch' on 'Window': Illegal invocation
    at <anonymous>:5639:16203
```
The error message may vary from browser to browser bug calling fetch in an illegal object is always part of it

#### Causes

1. The LastPass extension replaces the global `fetch` with a function that is basically like this:
   ```
   // ...
   originalFetchFunction.apply(this, arguments)
   // ...
   ```

2. PowerBI replaces the `self` with an own `Window` object. Perhaps for sandboxing purposes. The code is huge and hard to navigate but there is a comment about this:
    ```
    //overwrite global variables with window values for PowerBI libraries
    ```
    Based on the code it tries to overwrite `window` too but somehow it remains intact. Again this piece of the code is not well understood.

3. The mapbox-gl.js uses `fetch` by calling it like `self.fetch(...)`.
    Here `self` is PowerBI's generated object and `fetch` it LastPass's code. When the LastPass fetch tries to apply the original fetch function to the generated object it fails.

#### Mitigation

The `window` object is still the original native `Window` object so replacing the generated `self` to this original `Window` solves the problem. In practice it means a line
```
self = window
```
before importing mapbox-gl
